title: Challenges of Acquiring Compositional Inductive Biases via Meta-Learning
abstract: Meta-learning is typically applied to settings where, given a distribution
  over related training tasks, the goal is to learn inductive biases that aid in generalization
  to new tasks from this distribution. Alternatively, we might consider a scenario
  where, given an inductive bias, we must construct a family of tasks that will inject
  the given inductive bias into a parametric model (e.g. a neural network) if meta-training
  is performed on the constructed task family. Inspired by recent work showing that
  such an algorithm can leverage meta-learning to improve generalization on a single-task
  learning problem, we consider various approaches to both a) the construction of
  the family of tasks and b) the procedure for selecting support sets for a particular
  single-task problem, the SCAN compositional generalization benchmark. We perform
  ablation experiments aimed at identifying when a meta-learning algorithm and family
  of tasks can impart the compositional inductive bias needed to solve SCAN. We conclude
  that existing meta-learning approaches to injecting compositional inductive biases
  are brittle and difficult to interpret, showing high sensitivity to both the family
  of meta-training tasks and the procedure for selecting support sets.
