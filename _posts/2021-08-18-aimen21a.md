title: Stress Testing of Meta-learning Approaches for Few-shot Learning
abstract: Meta-learning (ML) has emerged as a promising learning method under resource
  constraints such as few-shot learning. ML approaches typically propose a methodology
  to learn generalizable models. In this work-in-progress paper, we put the recent
  ML approaches to a stress test to discover their limitations. Precisely, we measure
  the performance of ML approaches for few-shot learning against increasing task complexity.
  Our results show a quick degradation in the performance of initialization strategies
  for ML (MAML, TAML, and MetaSGD), while surprisingly, approaches that use an optimization
  strategy (MetaLSTM) perform significantly better. We further demonstrate the effectiveness
  of an optimization strategy for ML (MetaLSTM++) trained in a MAML manner over a
  pure optimization strategy. Our experiments also show that the optimization strategies
  for ML achieve higher transferability from simple to complex tasks.
