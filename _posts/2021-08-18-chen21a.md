title: 'MetaDelta: A Meta-Learning System for Few-shot Image Classification'
abstract: 'Meta-learning aims at learning quickly on novel tasks with limited data
  by transferring generic experience learned from previous tasks. Naturally, few-shot
  learning has been one of the most popular applications for meta-learning. However,
  existing meta-learning algorithms rarely consider the time and resource efficiency
  or the generalization capacity for unknown datasets, which limits their applicability
  in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose MetaDelta, a novel practical
  meta-learning system for the few-shot image classification. MetaDelta consists of
  two core components: i) multiple meta-learners supervised by a central controller
  to ensure efficiency, and ii) a meta-ensemble module in charge of integrated inference
  and better generalization. In particular, each meta-learner in MetaDelta is composed
  of a unique pre-trained encoder fine-tuned by batch training and parameter-free
  decoder used for prediction. MetaDelta ranks first in the final phase in the AAAI
  2021 MetaDL Challenge. '
