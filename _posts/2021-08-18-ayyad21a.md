title: Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Learning with Prototypical Random Walks
abstract: Recent progress has shown that few-shot learning can be improved with access
  to unlabelled data,  known as semi-supervised few-shot learning(SS-FSL). We introduce
  an SS-FSL approach, dubbed as Prototypical Random Walk Networks(PRWN), built on
  top of Prototypical Networks (PN). We develop a random walk semi-supervised loss
  that enables the network to learn representations that are compact and well-separated.
  Our work is related to the very recent development of graph-based approaches for
  few-shot learning. However, we show that compact and well-separated class representations
  can be achieved by modeling our prototypical random walk notion without needing
  additional graph-NN parameters or requiring a transductive setting where a collective
  test set is provided. Our model outperforms baselines in most benchmarks with significant
  improvements in some cases. Our model, trained with 40$%$ of the data as labeled,
  compares competitively against fully supervised prototypical networks, trained on
  100$%$ of the labels, even outperforming it in the 1-shot mini-Imagenet case with
  50.89$%$ to 49.4$%$ accuracy. We also show that our loss is resistant to distractors,
  unlabeled data that does not belong to any of the training classes, and hence reflecting
  robustness to labeled/unlabeled class distribution mismatch.
