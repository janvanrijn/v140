title: Transfer learning based few-shot classification using optimal transport mapping
  from preprocessed latent space of backbone neural network
abstract: The MetaDL Challenge 2020 focused on image classification tasks in few-shot
  settings. This paper describes second best submission in the competition. Our meta
  learning approach modifies the distribution of classes in a latent space produced
  by a backbone network for each class in order to better follow the Gaussian distribution.
  After this operation which we call Latent Space Transform algorithm, centers of
  classes are further aligned in an iterative fashion of the Expectation Maximisation
  algorithm to utilize information in unlabeled data that are often provided on top
  of few labelled instances. For this task, we utilize optimal transport mapping using
  the Sinkhorn algorithm. Our experiments show that this approach outperforms previous
  works as well as other variants of the algorithm, using K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm,
  Gaussian Mixture Models, etc.
