title: Advances in MetaDL: AAAI 2021 challenge and workshop
abstract: To stimulate advances in meta-learning using deep learning techniques (MetaDL),
  we organized in 2021 a challenge and an associated workshop. This paper presents
  the design of the challenge and its results, and summarizes presentations made at
  the workshop. The challenge focused on few-shot learning classification tasks of
  small images.  Participantsâ€™ code submissions were run in a uniform manner, under
  tight computational constraints. This put pressure on solution designs to use existing
  architecture backbones and/or pre-trained networks. Winning methods featured various
  classifiers trained on top of the second last layer of popular CNN backbones, fined-tuned
  on the meta-training data (not necessarily in an episodic manner), then trained
  on the labeled support and tested on the unlabeled query sets of the meta-test data.
