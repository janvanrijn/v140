title: Is Algorithm Selection Worth It? Comparing Selecting Single Algorithms and
  Parallel Execution
abstract: For many practical problems, there is more than one algorithm or approach
  to solve them. Such algorithms often have complementary performance â€“ where one
  fails, another performs well, and vice versa. Per-instance algorithm selection leverages
  this by employing portfolios of complementary algorithms to solve sets of difficult
  problems, choosing the most appropriate algorithm for each problem instance. However,
  this requires complex models to effect this selection and introduces overhead to
  compute the data needed for those models. On the other hand, even basic hardware
  is more than capable of running several algorithms in parallel. We investigate the
  tradeoff between selecting a single algorithm and running multiple in parallel and
  incurring a slowdown because of contention for shared resources. Our results indicate
  that algorithm selection is worth it, especially for large portfolios.
