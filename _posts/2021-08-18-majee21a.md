title: Few-Shot Learning for Road Object Detection
abstract: 'Few-shot learning is a problem of high interest in the evolution of deep
  learning. In this work, we consider the problem of few-shot object detection (FSOD)
  in a real-world, class-imbalanced scenario. For our experiments, we utilize the
  India Driving Dataset (IDD), as it includes a class of less-occurring road objects
  in the image dataset and hence provides a setup suitable for few-shot learning.
  We evaluate both metric-learning and meta- learning based FSOD methods, in two experimental
  settings: (i) representative (same-domain) splits from IDD, that evaluates the ability
  of a model to learn in the context of road images, and (ii) object classes with
  less-occurring object samples, similar to the open-set setting in real-world. From
  our experiments, we demonstrate that the metric-learning method outperforms meta-
  learning on the novel classes by (i) 11.2 mAP points on the same domain, and (ii)
  1.0 mAP point on the open-set. We also show that our extension of object classes
  in a real-world open dataset offers a rich ground for few-shot learning studies.'
